## Sun Chaser

![Sun Chaser Dashboard](public/screenshot.png)

Sun Chaser is a web dashboard created for the [MagnoliaConf Hackathon](https://2025.magnoliaconf.com/), built with React, Vite, and KendoReact. It's the first working version of a larger art-tech project: a van outfitted with a solar-powered webserver and GPS adventure logging.

Core Features
	‚Ä¢	Interactive map showing the van's route and general location (well there is a map)
	‚Ä¢	Live stats on solar output, uptime, and travel metrics (no)
	‚Ä¢	Build details and technical notes on the van and server setup (nah)
	‚Ä¢	Photo gallery and travel log from the road (nope)
	‚Ä¢	Dynamic data grid and charts powered by KendoReact (yep, mostly)
	‚Ä¢	Sensor readings streamed from the onboard system (nope)
	‚Ä¢	Customizable dashboard views and UI experiments (eh)
	‚Ä¢	Reflections on digital nomadism and creative tech (nah)
