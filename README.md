## Sun Chaser

Sun Chaser is a web dashboard created for the MagnoliaConf Hackathon, built with React, Vite, and KendoReact. It’s the first working version of a larger art-tech project: a van outfitted with a solar-powered webserver and GPS adventure logging.

Core Features
	•	Interactive map showing the van’s route and general location
	•	Live stats on solar output, uptime, and travel metrics
	•	Build details and technical notes on the van and server setup
	•	Photo gallery and travel log from the road
	•	Dynamic data grid and charts powered by KendoReact
	•	Sensor readings streamed from the onboard system
	•	Customizable dashboard views and UI experiments
	•	Reflections on digital nomadism and creative tech
